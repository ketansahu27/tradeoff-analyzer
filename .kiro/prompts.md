Build a tool that compares options and explains trade-offs, instead of 
giving a single answer. The goal is to help users choose, not just 
consume information.

Examples:
* Compare two APIs or cloud services based on constraints
* "Which approach should I use?" with pros/cons
* Tech stack comparison given requirements
