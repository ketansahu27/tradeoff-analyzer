📖 Overview
When choosing between technologies, developers and teams often face information overload. Articles say "X is best for Y" but rarely explain what you're giving up. Trade-off Analyzer empowers users to make informed choices based on their specific constraints and priorities.
✨ Features
🎯 Pre-built Comparison Templates

Cloud Providers: AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure
Database Systems: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs Redis
API Approaches: REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC

🎚️ Interactive Constraint Settings
Adjust sliders to reflect your project requirements:

Budget Priority (Low → High)
Scalability Needs (Low → High)
Acceptable Complexity (Low → High)
Time to Market (Low → High)

📊 Comprehensive Analysis
Each option displays:

✅ Strengths - What it excels at
⚠️ Trade-offs - What you sacrifice
🎯 Best For - Ideal use cases
💰 Pricing - Cost considerations
📈 Overall Score - Relative rating

💡 Smart Recommendations
Get personalized suggestions based on YOUR specific constraints, not generic "best practices"
🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 - Structure
React 18 - UI Components (CDN)
Tailwind CSS - Styling
Lucide React - Icons
Babel Standalone - JSX Transformation

👥 Teams evaluating cloud migration options
🎓 Students learning about technology trade-offs
🏢 Organizations making technical decisions under constraints
📚 Educators teaching system design concepts

🌟 Why This Tool?
Traditional tech comparison tools often give you a single "winner" without context. Trade-off Analyzer is different:

❌ Not: "Use AWS because it's the best"
✅ Instead: "AWS excels at X but sacrifices Y. Choose it if you need Z."

The goal is to empower decision-making, not just provide information.
